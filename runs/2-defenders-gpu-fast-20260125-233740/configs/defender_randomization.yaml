# Defender domain randomization config
# Adds variability to defender behavior for training robustness

behavior_modes:
  # Probability distribution over defender strategies
  # Must sum to 1.0
  patrol: 0.5          # Standard patrol around objective
  guard_objective: 0.3 # Stay close to objective, minimal movement
  intercept: 0.2       # Aggressively chase detected attackers

reaction:
  # Delay before defender reacts to new detections (seconds)
  delay_min: 0.0
  delay_max: 0.5
  
  # Probability of taking random action instead of AI decision
  p_random_action: 0.05  # 5% epsilon-random per step
  
jitter:
  # Angular jitter added to heading decisions (degrees)
  aim_std: 5.0        # Std dev of Gaussian noise to aim/heading
  
  # Decision noise
  decision_noise: 0.1  # Probability of sub-optimal decision

patrol_randomization:
  # Randomize patrol waypoints per episode
  enabled: true
  jitter_radius: 10.0  # Max distance to move waypoint from base position (meters)
